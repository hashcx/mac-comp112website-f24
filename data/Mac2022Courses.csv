Yet cracks in the walls of racism and empire have also always existed, with gestures of solidarity and whole solidarity movements pushing forward with new possibilities and imagined futures. In this discussion-based course, we will look for the common threads that link David Fagen (Black U.S. army soldier who defected and joined the Philippine nationalists in 1899) to the Vietnam antiwar movement (1955-1975) and to Grace Lee Boggs (Chinese American philosopher activist based in Detroit, 1905-2015) along with many other individuals and events. Among the significant questions we will consider are: What makes an insurrectionist different from an ally or a rabble rouser or a survivalist? What lessons can be drawn from the global COVID pandemic and the Russian war in Ukraine? How can we replace a culture of violence with a culture of peace? Books and films include: The White Racial Frame (Joe Feagin), How to be an Anti-Racist (Ibram X. Kendi), ""Amigo"" (John Sayles), ""American Revolutionary"" (Grace Lee).",Writing WA

European (and, later, Euro-Americans) alternated among fascination, fear, and frustration toward American Indians, while American Indians sought to maintain tribal sovereignty and control over their lands, cultures, religions, politics, and lifestyles amidst continuing encroachment and settlement. This course examines American Indian history to 1871 - the year that Congress stopped making treaties with Native nations - by considering the complicated and multifaceted history of the nation's indigenous people. By looking at American Indian interactions with Spanish, French, British, and American explorers, settlers, missionaries, militaries, and government officials, this courses argues that the history of American Indians is essential to understanding past as well as present issues. Furthermore, this course looks to move beyond the notion that American Indian history is one of inevitable decline by creating a more nuanced understanding of the American Indian experience from pre-contact toward the twentieth century.",

Jazz history is full of such threshold moments, as each generation continued to elevate jazz – and thus the entire diaspora of Black America – to new artistic and socially progressive heights.  This course will trace the advancement of jazz from a regional articulation of African-American culture (New Orleans at the turn of the twentieth century), to a diverse international phenomenon, one whose fundamental thrust has served as a foil to prevailing white hegemony.  There are three basic aims: (1) a general historical survey of jazz's development, through primary source and scholarly readings, (2) an analysis of the stylistic evolution of jazz through the study of repertoire and recordings, and (3) critical analysis of race, gender, and cultural conflict throughout the ongoing legacy of what has been called one of America's great musical art forms.

Human history, culture and socio-political nuances in different parts of the world result in distinctive challenges as well as enigmatically optimistic scenarios with respect to wildlife conservation. In this seminar we will investigate perspectives from South Asia where animals and humans coexist at very high density and proximity, consider the North American system where views about biodiversity can often be very polarizing, and explore conservation in Africa where pockets of pristine wilderness persist. We will engage with the primary literature of wildlife conservation, hear from scientists on the frontlines, and discuss the idea that there could be a unifying model that safeguards biodiversity without detrimentally impeding human development.

Tolkien had a “secret vice”: creating imaginary languages based on medieval languages. Come learn how Tolkien drew on the Welsh language and medieval Welsh literature to craft the world of Middle-Earth and the language of the Elves. As we read our way through medieval Wales, we will encounter sorcerer-bards, goddesses, magical treasures, and mysterious creatures (who are rarely what they seem). Studying the basics of the Welsh language will allow us to be enchanted by the strange and poignant stories of the Mabinogion, the Book of Taliesin, and the Book of Aneirin.

How does a novel go from scribbled notes to finished paperback? What goes into editing, printing, and marketing a short story collection? This course will shed light on this exciting field through a combination of readings, talks with publishing professionals, in-class discussion, and hands-on work. We will learn about publishing by tracing the literary work through the processes of acquisition, editing, production, marketing, and publicity, and into the hands of the reader. Additional topics will include recent trends in technology, book editing, book reviewing, and the roles of the literary agent, and the independent publisher. We will take advantage of the extraordinary publishing resources in the Twin Cities and beyond through guest speakers. Assignments will include writing query letters and catalog copy, presenting publisher profiles, editing a short story, and writing a final paper on publishing issues. This course is designed for readers who want to know how the book they’re holding got into their hands, for writers who want to know what happens when they send their manuscripts to publishers, and for those interested in publishing as a future career.",

Themes of the course include: reading and writing as subversive acts, representation of gendered and classed experiences of Blackness, and literary production and innovation as agents of political and social change. We will also connect the crises surrounding Black citizenship in the United States, so often represented by African American writers before 1900, to the present, honoring these early writers’ ongoing legacy of national critique and Black solidarity. We will also foreground early African American literature as art, as an at once aesthetic and political project, reading it closely and appreciatively. Requirements include: brief written responses to the readings, a presentation, a medium-length essay and a revision of it, and a final reflection essay. This course fulfills the English major requirement either of a course focused on literature by U.S. writers of color or a course on 19th-century American literature.","Writing WA

Before the actors say a word, or the post production team adds that perfect shade of pink to the sunset, a film or television show lives solely on the page. It lives as a piece of writing created in the mind of a storyteller. No matter what happens later, it always begins as a reading experience. In this course, we will concentrate on every aspect of that initial and vital stage of creating visual stories. We will study produced scripts to see how they master visual storytelling, pitch perfect dialogue, and satisfying structure. While there is no paint-by-numbers formula for a perfect screenplay or teleplay, there is a constantly evolving form full of principles the greatest writers have relied on since the birth of these mediums.

In this course, we will explore the literature, visual art, music, and films created in Russia and the surrounding region from the Soviet period into the present day. We start with the political and artistic revolutions in the final days of imperial Russia, then move through the eras of the bloody Bolshevik revolution, the repressive Stalinist regime, and the devastation of World War II. Next, we look at the cultural thaw of the 1960s, the new freedoms of the perestroika era, and the fall of the Soviet Union. We then turn our attention to contemporary Russia under Putin. We will examine cultural texts in their artistic, social, and political contexts, seeking to better understand Russia’s relationship with the West, the experience of ethnic minorities in the Soviet and post-Soviet period, and Russia’s history of authoritarianism, as well as the struggle against it. Studying culture produced in Russia and the region in the Soviet and post-Soviet period will help us to empathize with those who lived through that tumultuous era and kept creative expression alive in the midst of unimaginable hardships. We will also be attentive to the contemporary situation in the wake of Putin’s war of aggression against Ukraine, which has changed global dynamics so profoundly. We will use our course materials to shed light on current events in the post-Soviet sphere, striving to understand how we got here and what hope there might be for the future.

In fact, however, leisure travel, the growth of industrial capitalism and globalization, and new models of class hierarchies and notions of gender all gained strength in the nineteenth century in part through their intersections with rhetorics of race. This course will interrogate notions of race as they were being invented—exploring how they were popularized and used to dominate, how they failed, and how they were resisted in 19th-century Britain. We will read canonical and non-canonical texts, including works by writers of color, visual images, scientific theories, fiction, and non-fiction. Considering locations throughout the British empire, we will explore intersections of race with the history of British slavery, colonial settlement, gender politics, enfranchisement, war, and religion.

In addition, we will explore how various characteristics of the natural world have affected the broad patterns of human society, sometimes harming or hindering life and other times enabling rapid development and expansion. By bringing nature into the study of human history and the human past into the study of nature, we will begin to see the connections and interdependencies between the two that are often overlooked.","Writing WP

This concept of happiness is noticeably absent from the founding French principles of human rights, which focus instead on “liberty, equality and fraternity”. Yet the French have pursued well-being and happiness to the same extent as Americans, but in different forms and with different goals. In this course, we will study what it means to be happy - à la française - by studying works of fiction, art and philosophy from the 19th century. This period is well known as a time when utopian societies flourished, when consumerism and leisure activities exploded, and when theories about melancholia and hysteria were popularized. Central questions that we will discuss include: what are the keys to living a “good” life? How are the concepts of well-being and happiness connected to cultural and artistic endeavors? What can we learn from this time period, and how are our own views of well-being and happiness influenced by it? This course will count for the pre-20th century requirement for the French major.

The course adopts a political economy perspective to trace the complex interactions of institutions, politics, and economic systems that shape initiatives for more sustainable cities. Students will work in the first part of the course to enhance their understanding of core concepts and best practices that constitute the professional field of sustainable urban development and assemble a framework for analyzing the ways in which sustainability initiatives come to fruition and approach the idea of sustainability in a particular way. Equipped with this framework, we then analyze case studies in the second part of course that focus on the meaning of sustainability, its practice internationally, and the ultimate impact of these practices on ecological balance, economic sustainability, and social equity in the urban environment. Toward these ends, students will conduct a semester-long capstone research project that investigates a particular urban sustainability initiative in the world by tracing the political economy of its creation and considering its impact on society, economy, and environment.

The popularity of vampires has waxed and waned for over a hundred years, partially because vampirism can be used as a metaphor for almost anything-from the plague to sexuality to addiction.

European (and, later, Euro-Americans) alternated among fascination, fear, and frustration toward American Indians, while American Indians sought to maintain tribal sovereignty and control over their lands, cultures, religions, politics, and lifestyles amidst continuing encroachment and settlement. This course examines American Indian history to 1871 - the year that Congress stopped making treaties with Native nations - by considering the complicated and multifaceted history of the nation's indigenous people. By looking at American Indian interactions with Spanish, French, British, and American explorers, settlers, missionaries, militaries, and government officials, this courses argues that the history of American Indians is essential to understanding past as well as present issues.

These figures - as well as their incarnations as cyberpunks and mecha-warriors, sex workers and teen rebels - help us explore Japanese film's engagement with the strictures of middle-class society, the constrained status of women, fantasy and escapism, sexuality and desire. Weekly screenings and discussion will be supplemented by readings in film theory and cultural criticism.

In this course, our objective is to explore the ways in which Caribbean literature, art and performance offer powerful tools of decolonization in the struggle to protect cultural sovereignty as well as ecological diversity. To that end, we will learn how Caribbean writers, intellectuals, artists, and musicians confront the various challenges that islands of the region face, including political domination, racism, poverty, sexism, toxicity and transmigration. The course will challenge commonly-held notions of the Caribbean as merely a site for leisure and pleasure.

But what exactly is this future we care so much about, and for what sort of future should we strive? This class introduces fundamental problems of philosophy by exploring metaphysical, epistemological and ethical problems about the future. We begin with the central concerns of philosophy itself: what is real? what do I know? what is good? what really matters? We then consider the puzzling nature of the future, which we value immensely, and worry about, as though it is fully real. Are the past and present more real than the future? This raises interesting questions of our moral attitude to the future: do we have obligations to persons and generations that do not yet exist or no longer exist? Might we have an obligation to ensure that someone does (or does not) exist in the future? Future humans will face ethical issues that are worth thinking about in the present. For example, is it acceptable for future humans to colonize other planets as past humans have colonized other continents? There are a number of threats that may prevent a human future altogether: pandemics, war, climate change. How do we gauge these threats and act accordingly? And if it turns out we are doomed, how would this affect the meaning of the life we have left? If we survive, human nature is likely to undergo significant change with the rise of technologies like artificial intelligence, genetic engineering and biomedical enhancement.

Both camps typically rely on the same underlying concept of what freedom is: something an individual exercises with their free will. In this course, we will work to gain a measure of distance on this common view of freedom by counterposing it with premodern as well as modern strains of thought that go against the grain of classical liberalism.

In this course, we will explore the literature, visual art, music, and films created in Russia and the surrounding region from the Soviet period into the present day. We start with the political and artistic revolutions in the final days of imperial Russia, then move through the eras of the bloody Bolshevik revolution, the repressive Stalinist regime, and the devastation of World War II. Next, we look at the cultural thaw of the 1960s, the new freedoms of the perestroika era, and the fall of the Soviet Union. We then turn our attention to contemporary Russia under Putin. We will examine cultural texts in their artistic, social, and political contexts, seeking to better understand Russia’s relationship with the West, the experience of ethnic minorities in the Soviet and post-Soviet period, and Russia’s history of authoritarianism, as well as the struggle against it. Studying culture produced in Russia and the region in the Soviet and post-Soviet period will help us to empathize with those who lived through that tumultuous era and kept creative expression alive in the midst of unimaginable hardships. We will also be attentive to the contemporary situation in the wake of Putin’s war of aggression against Ukraine, which has changed global dynamics so profoundly. We will use our course materials to shed light on current events in the post-Soviet sphere, striving to understand how we got here and what hope there might be for the future.  This course will include a group project with the aim of supporting refugees displaced by Russia’s war on Ukraine.

In this course we will work with the social model of disability, by approaching the study of dis/abled bodies (and minds) through the ever-shifting historical, socio-cultural, and political formations that name them as such. We will draw on classics of disability studies and emergent feminist sociological texts on disability, as well as memoir, personal essays, pop culture and current events and disability justice activism. By understanding disability as a vector of privilege and oppression, we will analyze its intersections with other vectors of oppression, such as race, class, gender, sexuality and citizenship.

How is inequality related to a person’s race, class, gender, sexuality, and other dimensions of social identity? What social practices perpetuate the ongoing reproduction of inequality? How is inequality embodied and lived? And, further, what does striving for a world without inequality look like when we have inherited the legacy of this already unequal world?

In fact, the Caribbean was global centuries before the term globalization came into vogue.

In this course, our objective is to explore the ways in which Caribbean literature, art and performance offer powerful tools of decolonization in the struggle to protect cultural sovereignty as well as ecological diversity. To that end, we will learn how Caribbean writers, intellectuals, artists, and musicians confront the various challenges that islands of the region face, including political domination, racism, poverty, sexism, toxicity and transmigration. The course will challenge commonly-held notions of the Caribbean as merely a site for leisure and pleasure.

We will explore how different histories of women’s and gender studies intersect to expand this matrix of identities.  We will debate and critique diverse identities—from Norse to Black to Indigenous. We will study how feminists and their allies have fought economic exploitation, challenged racial discrimination, protested gender oppression, redefined environmental and industrial relations, and gained strength from political and cultural coalitions, across the world.  This course invites you to analyze and situate your identities, your commitments, and your responsibilities in relation to the academic and other bodies of knowledge that form the foundation of a liberal arts education.

When translated into Japanese, Hermione Granger (a female character in the Harry Potter series) ends sentences with soft-sounding forms, while Harry Potter and his best friend Ron use more assertive forms. Do these fictional representations reflect reality? How are certain forms associated with femininity or masculinity? Do speakers of Japanese conform to the norm or rebel against it?

In fact, some years ago now Time Magazine declared that we are at the “transgender tipping point.” And yet, alongside this positive media coverage, we see legislatures across the country using trans-ness to foment fear as well as record levels of violence against transgender individuals, in particular trans women of color. In all of these instances, it’s useful to consider how and why the specter of transness is raised. What social and political work does that figure do? This course investigates the ways that ideas about normative and non-normative gender are produced in the context of white supremacy and capitalism, recognizing that discourses about gender, race, class, sexuality and nation are co-constitutive and historically contingent. Foregrounding intersectionality, we begin with situating the production and policing norms around gender and sexuality as a key tactic of settler colonialism, and then we move forward in time through the nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first centuries to think about how norms around racialized gender and sexuality have been policed, resisted, and transformed in various historical moments. This course will examine transness as a practice of gender transgression, rather than solely an identity category, one which is historically and geographically contingent. In this class, we will ask: In doing so, we will ask: What has gender non-conformity meant in various  historical moments? How do race, class, gender, sexuality, and disability structure trans lives and communities? How have key institutions within the US constructed ideas about gender normativity and policed gender transgression? How has that policing impacted and shaped trans life? What is the relationship between feminism and trans people and trans liberation? How have trans people envisioned and fought for social justice? What space can trans embodiment and politics open up for new ways of living, relating, and imagining otherwise?","Writing WA
