The first we'll talk about it in terms of points in a coordinate system (longitudinal, latitude). \n\n### Starbucks Example {-}\n\nThe `Starbucks` [data](data/starbucks.csv), compiled by Danny Kaplan, contains information about every Starbucks in the world at the time the data were collected. It includes the `Latitude` and `Longitude` of each location.  Let's start by using familiar ggplot plotting tools.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Starbucks locations\nStarbucks <- read_csv(\"https://bcheggeseth.github.io/112_spring_2023/data/starbucks.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = Starbucks) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude),\n    alpha = 0.2,\n    size = 0.2\n  ) +\n  theme_classic()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](06-Spatial_Viz_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-3-1.pdf){fig-pos='H' fig-alt='Scatterplot of Starbucks locations at time of data collection. Starbucks is a global company with locations on most continents.'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe code for a point pattern probably looks familiar.  To highlight the geographical nature of this scatterplot, we can superimpose the points on top of a background map, using the `ggmap()` function from the `ggmap` library. \n\n*NOTE: We used to be able to easily bring in Google maps. As of mid-2018, in order to bring those in, you need to have a registered API key with Google. If you want to do that, see `google_key` in the help. Then, see the documentation for `get_map()`. We will bring in other types of maps since Google maps are harder to do now and require you to submit credit card information.*\n\nWe will use a stamen map as our background. You can also take a look at stamen maps on their [website](http://maps.stamen.com/#watercolor/12/37.7706/-122.3782). First, let's look at an example. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Get the map information\nworld <- get_stadiamap(\n  bbox = c(left = -180, bottom = -57, right = 179, top = 82.1),\n  maptype = \"stamen_terrain\",\n  zoom = 2\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in `get_stamen_url()`:\n! Stadia Maps requires an API key; see `ggmap::register_stadiamaps()`.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Plot the points on the map\nggmap(world) + # creates the map \"background\"\n  geom_point(\n    data = Starbucks,\n    aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude),\n    alpha = .3,\n    size = 0.2\n  ) +\n  theme_map()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'world' not found\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nNext, we will walk through the `get_stadiamap()` function inputs or arguments. The code below is what was used to get the world map information.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nget_stadiamap(\n  bbox = c(left = -180, bottom = -57, right = 179, top = 82.1),\n  maptype = \"stamen_terrain\",\n  zoom = 2\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n**`bbox`**\n\nThe `bbox` argument tells it the minimum and maximum latitude and longitude points. So, left is the minimum longitude, right is the maximum longitude, bottom is the minimum latitude, and top is the maximum latitude. \n\n- **Helpful Resource**: One helpful trick is to go to [openstreetmap](https://www.openstreetmap.org): zoom in on the area of interest, click export (you can customize the area you want to export), and you will see all the values you need (left, bottom, right, top). You may have to modify them slightly, which you can do after your initial plot.\n\n**`maptype`**\n\nThe `maptype` tells it the style of the map. Check out the different options by looking in the `get_stadiamap` help (type `?get_stadiamap` in the console).\n\n**`zoom`**\n\nWhen you make a large area, you need to decrease the zoom, otherwise it will take too long to load. So, it's a good idea to start with a small zoom and you can always make it bigger if you want. This might seem counter-intuitive at first. Think of the zoom level as the level of detail. So, smaller numbers show less detail and larger numbers more detail. \n\n- **Helpful Trick** go to the stamanmaps webpage and search for the location you are mapping. Then, in the URL, you can see the zoom number. For example, this link  is a map of St. Paul: [http://maps.stamen.com/terrain/#12/44.9531/-93.0904](http://maps.stamen.com/terrain/#12/44.9531/-93.0904). Notice the number `12` next to  `/terrain/`. That means it is zoomed in at 12. \n\n**`ggmap()`**\n\nWe save the the map information from `get_stadiamap()` to a named value and then use it in `ggmap()`.\n\nThe `ggmap()` function will print the \"background\" map. Think of it as the providing the canvas on which we will plot. This takes the place of our usual `ggplot()`.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggmap(world)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'world' not found\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nAfter that, we can use the `geom_XXX()` functions from `ggplot2` that we are used to in order to put points, lines, etc. on top of the map. But, we need to remember to also provide the data we are using in the `geom_XXX()` function(s) we use since we do not have the `ggplot()` function in which to provide it. \n\n**`theme_map()`**\n\nThe last line of the code is `theme_map()`. This is optional, but it often makes it look nice. It removes excess axis lines and moves guides/legends. \n\nSo, the final map as a world map as the background with points plotted on top that show the Starbucks locations. The points are 20 percent (0.2) of their usual size and have a transparency level of 0.3. \n\n### Resources {-}\n\n* [Prof. Lendway's demo video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/2k8O-Y_uiRU)\n* [ggmap examples](https://github.com/dkahle/ggmap) from `ggmap` maintainer David Kahle  \n* [`ggmap` cheatsheet](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/sites/default/files/2020-04/ggmapCheatsheet.pdf)\n\n### Examples: More with Starbucks {-}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.example .cell-code}\nNow it is your turn to work with the Starbucks data. \n```\n:::\n\n\n\na.

Construct a new map of Starbucks locations in the Twin Cities metro area (approximately the five county metro area).     \nc. In the Twin Cities plot, play with the zoom number. What does it do?  (just describe what it does - don't actually include more than one map).     \nd. Try a couple different map types (see `get_stadiamap()` in help and look at `maptype`). Include a map with one of the other map types.\ne. Add a point to the map that indicates Macalester College and label it appropriately.

For choropleth maps, instead of visualizing our data as points with different aesthetics (size, color, transparency, etc.), we color different regions (or mathematically, polygons) on the maps based on data values. To do this we need to specify both the geometric regions on which the data resides (counties, states, zip codes, etc.), and then wrangle the data so that there is one value per region. \n\nLet's return to the Starbucks data. First, we will create a new dataset, `starbucks_us_by_state` that limits the data to the US, finds the number of Starbucks in each state, and creates a state name that is in all lowercase letters that matches the state name in the `region` variable of the `states_map` dataset.\n\nThe `states_map` dataset gives information about creating the borders of the US states. The data is retrieved using the `map_data()` function. Run `?map_data` in the console to see more information about what other maps are available. There are also other packages that provide different types of maps.\n\nThen, we can use `geom_map()` to create a choropleth map. Let's take a look at the map and we'll go through the details after.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create a new Starbucks dataset that\n# - filters to the US\n# - summarizes the number of Starbucks in each state\n# - has full names of states in lowercase letters (to match to states_map data created next)\n\nstarbucks_us_by_state <- Starbucks %>%\n  filter(Country == \"US\") %>%\n  count(`State/Province`) %>%\n  mutate(state_name = str_to_lower(abbr2state(`State/Province`)))\n\n# US states map information - coordinates used to draw borders\nstates_map <- map_data(\"state\")\n\n# map that colors state by number of Starbucks\nstarbucks_us_by_state %>%\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_map(\n    map = states_map,\n    aes(\n      map_id = state_name,\n      fill = n\n    )\n  ) +\n  # This assures the map looks decently nice:\n  expand_limits(x = states_map$long, y = states_map$lat) +\n  theme_map()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](06-Spatial_Viz_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-12-1.pdf){fig-pos='H' fig-alt='State-level choropleth map showing number of Starbucks per state. California has by far the most Starbucks locations in this dataset.'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nNow, let's look more closely at what each piece of the code below is doing.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstarbucks_us_by_state %>%\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_map(\n    map = states_map,\n    aes(\n      map_id = state_name,\n      fill = n\n    )\n  ) +\n  expand_limits(x = states_map$long, y = states_map$lat) +\n  theme_map()\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n### Choose a Map {-}\n\nThe `map` argument tells R at which level to create the map. Really, it tells it how to draw all the borders This is a very special data set. According to the `geom_map()` documentation, it is a \"data frame that contains the map coordinates ... It **must** contain columns x or long, y or lat, and region or id.\" We are using the `map_data()` function to create the map file (see above for more details. You can open the map data, `states_map`, and see that it adheres to the rules.\n\n### Connect Map ID/Region Variable to Data Being Plotted {-}\n\nThe `map_id` inside of `aes()` is a required aesthetic for the `geom_map()` geom. It tells R which variable is the region/id variable, in this case the state. It connects the `region` or `id` from the map (`region` variable in `states_map` dataset, in this example) to the dataset being plotted (`state_name` in `starbucks_us_by_state`, in this example). So `state_name` needs to have the same form as `region`, which is why we modified the state names in `starbucks_us_by_state`.\n\n\n### Use `ggplot2` Features {-}\n\nWe tell it to fill in the states by the variable `n`, the number of Starbucks in each state. With the `geom_map()` geom, it will fill in the borders of the regions we defined in the `map` argument.\n\n\n### `expand_limits()` {-}\n\nUse `expand_limits()` to assure that the map covers the entire area it's supposed to. We put the longitude variable from `states_map` for the `x` argument and the latitude variable from `states_map` for the `y` argument to assure the map stretches across the entire range of longitudes and latitudes in the map.  \n\n\n### `theme_map()` {-}\n\nThis is a personal preference, but `theme_map()` often makes the map look nicer.\n\n\n### Add `ggplot2` Layers {-}\n\nYou can add any of the `ggplot2` layers on top of this map. In this example, we've added MN Starbucks as points, included a title, and changed the legend background (so it doesn't have one).\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstarbucks_us_by_state %>%\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_map(\n    map = states_map,\n    aes(\n      map_id = state_name,\n      fill = n\n    )\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = Starbucks %>% filter(`State/Province` == \"MN\"),\n    aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude),\n    size = 0.05,\n    alpha = 0.2,\n    color = \"goldenrod\"\n  ) +\n  expand_limits(x = states_map$long, y = states_map$lat) +\n  labs(title = \"Starbucks in MN\") +\n  theme_map() +\n  theme(legend.background = element_blank())\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](06-Spatial_Viz_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-13-1.pdf){fig-pos='H' fig-alt='State-level choropleth map showing number of Starbucks per state and points for locations in MN.

It can be used outside of R, but we will only discuss using the `leaflet` library in R. \n\nThis library uses a different plotting framework from `ggplot2` although it still has a `tidyverse` feel due to its use of the pipe, `%>%` and the way it adds layers to the plot, just like in `ggplot2`.\n\n\n### Steps to Create a Map {-}\n\n1. Create a map widget by calling `leaflet()` and telling it the data to use.  \n2. Add a base map using `addTiles()` (the default) or `addProviderTiles()`.\n3. Add layers to the map by using layer functions (e.g. , `addMarkers()`, `addPolygons()`) to modify the map widget.   \n4. Repeat step 3 as desired.  \n5. Print the map widget to display it.\n\n### Creating a Map with Markers/Points {-}\n\nBelow, we create a basic map and add points of interest (the points are a layer on the map). The data are in `favorite_stp`, created below.\n\nThe function we will use to create the maps will look for certain variable names for latitude (lat, latitude) and longitude (lng, long, or longitude). If you do not name them one of those things or if the data you are using doesn't name them that, you need to call out the name explicitly (you'll see that next). You can use a \"two-finger scroll\" to zoom in and out.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Brianna's favorite St. Paul places - Used Google Maps to get coordinates\n# https://support.google.com/maps/answer/18539?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop\nfavorite_stp <- tibble(\n  place = c(\n    \"Macalester College\", \"Groveland Recreation Center\",\n    \"Due Focacceria\", \"Shadow Falls Park\", \"Mattocks Park\",\n    \"Carondelet Fields\", \"Pizza Luce\", \"Cold Front Ice Cream\"\n  ),\n  long = c(\n    -93.1712321, -93.1851310,\n    -93.1775469, -93.1944518, -93.171057,\n    -93.1582673, -93.1524256, -93.156652\n  ),\n  lat = c(\n    44.9378965, 44.9351034, 44.9274973,\n    44.9433359, 44.9284142, 44.9251236,\n    44.9468848, 44.9266768\n  )\n)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nleaflet(data = favorite_stp) %>% # base plot\n  addTiles() %>% # base map - default is openstreet map\n  addMarkers() # Adds markers - knows lat and long from names in data\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](06-Spatial_Viz_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-23-1.pdf){fig-pos='H' fig-alt='Interactive map of Brianna\\'s favorite places in the Twin Cities.'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe graph below is the same as above, but the code explicitly specifies latitude and longitude, which you would need to do if those variables had a name not recognized by the function, and adds labels. **WARNING: DO NOT FORGET THE ~ BEFORE THE VARIABLE NAMES!!!** \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nleaflet(data = favorite_stp) %>%\n  addTiles() %>%\n  addMarkers(\n    lng = ~long,\n    lat = ~lat,\n    label = ~place\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](06-Spatial_Viz_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-24-1.pdf){fig-pos='H' fig-alt='Interactive map of Brianna\\'s favorite places in the Twin Cities.'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nWe can change just about everything about our map.

In the example here, we use functions from the `sf` package to get the data in the right form. In the demo video listed under Resources below, a data.frame is translated to an `sf` object. Hopefully those two sets of instructions fit most of the cases you are interested in.\n\nIn the code chunk below, the function `st_read()` downloads the shape file for the counties of North Carolina, which is included in the `sf` package. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# North Carolina births and sids deaths\nnc <- st_read(system.file(\"shape/nc.shp\", package = \"sf\"),\n  quiet = TRUE\n) %>%\n  mutate(sid_per_1000birth_79 = SID79 / BIR79 * 1000)\n\n# Compute centroid (center) of each county\ncounty_centroid_lat_long <- as_tibble(st_coordinates(st_centroid(nc))) %>%\n  rename(\n    centr_long = X,\n    centr_lat = Y\n  )\n\n# County names and sid_per_1000birth_79\nnc_centroid_county <- st_drop_geometry(nc) %>%\n  select(NAME, sid_per_1000birth_79)\n\n# All centroid level info\nnc_centroid <- county_centroid_lat_long %>%\n  bind_cols(nc_centroid_county)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nThe dataset has number of births and number of SIDS cases in each county of North Carolina from 1974-1979 and 1979-1984. We computed a variable called `sid_per_1000birth_79` which is the number of SIDS cases per 1000 births in 1979. \n\nBelow, the the NAMES and geometry variables from the first five rows of the data are printed out. The `geometry` variable contains information about how to plot the boundaries of the counties. Open the dataset and examine the `geometry` variable. The `leaflet` function knows that the `geometry` variable contains this special information.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnc %>%\n  select(NAME, geometry) %>%\n  slice(1:5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nSimple feature collection with 5 features and 1 field\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -81.74107 ymin: 36.07282 xmax: -75.77316 ymax: 36.58965\nGeodetic CRS:  NAD27\n         NAME                       geometry\n1        Ashe MULTIPOLYGON (((-81.47276 3...\n2   Alleghany MULTIPOLYGON (((-81.23989 3...\n3       Surry MULTIPOLYGON (((-80.45634 3...\n4   Currituck MULTIPOLYGON (((-76.00897 3...\n5 Northampton MULTIPOLYGON (((-77.21767 3...\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nTo learn more about the data type `nc` into the Help menu or `?nc` into the console. \n\nThis plot puts the map with North Carolina county borders on top of the Open Street Map.

In `ggplot()`, we can map a variable to color or fill inside the aesthetic, but in the `leaflet` functions we cannot do this. Instead, we need to create a variable of hex color names that tells it how to color or fill. Thankfully, there are functions that help us do that! Let's walk through the detail of how we created the graph below. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# creates a function that can be used to map a variable to\n# the color palette using viridis \npal <- colorNumeric(\"viridis\",\n  domain = nc$sid_per_1000birth_79\n)\n\nleaflet(nc) %>%\n  addTiles() %>%\n  addPolygons(\n    fillColor = ~ pal(sid_per_1000birth_79), # fills according to that variable\n    fillOpacity = 0.7\n  ) # like alpha in ggplot\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](06-Spatial_Viz_files/figure-pdf/choro-1.pdf){fig-pos='H' fig-alt='Interactive map of North Carolina with counties colored by SID rate in 1979.'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe `colorNumeric()` function returns a function that maps a variable's values to colors in the given palette, in this case \"viridis\". So, `pal()` is a function. We can then use that function inside `addPolygons()`. If we apply the function to the `sid_per_1000birth_79` variable, it returns a variable of hex colors and the variable of colors is used to fill the counties. \n\nBelow we print out what happens when `pal()` is applied to `sid_per_1000birth_79`. We can see that it returns hex colors. So, the variable in the `fillColor` argument inside `addPolygons()` above, is a variable of hex color names.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(pal(nc$sid_per_1000birth_79))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"#440154\" \"#C0DF25\" \"#38588C\" \"#2A778E\" \"#34618D\" \"#26828E\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nAgain, this is different from `ggplot()`, where we could map a variable to color or fill and it would do the translating of variable to color scale for us. In the `leaflet` functions, we have to explicitly provide the colors in a variable. The `colorNumeric()` command helps you do that. `colorBin()`, `colorQuantile()`, and `colorFactor()` are other functions you might need to use depending on the type of variable you are trying to map to colors.\n\nThere are many options in `leaflet` that can be customized, much like `ggplot()`. Here is a commented set of code  to point out some useful functions and arguments: \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# creates a function that can be used to map a variable to\n# the color palette using viridis\npal <- colorNumeric(\"viridis\",\n  domain = nc$sid_per_1000birth_79\n)\n\nleaflet(nc) %>%\n  addTiles() %>%\n  addPolygons(\n    # skips drawing the borders:\n    stroke = FALSE,\n    # fills according to variable of hex colors:\n    fillColor = ~ pal(sid_per_1000birth_79),\n    # changes transparency, like alpha in ggplot\n    fillOpacity = 0.7,\n    # how much to simplify the plot when zooming:\n    smoothFactor = 0.5,\n    # changes what happens to the shape when we mouse over it\n    highlight = highlightOptions(\n      weight = 5,\n      color = \"black\",\n      fillOpacity = 0.9,\n      bringToFront = FALSE\n    )\n  ) %>%\n  addCircles(\n    data = nc_centroid,\n    lng = ~centr_long,\n    lat = ~centr_lat,\n    # label that appears when you click on the marker,\n    # in this case county name and sid_per_1000birth_79\n    # rounded to the 2nd decimal\n    popup = ~ paste(NAME, \": \",\n      round(sid_per_1000birth_79, 2),\n      sep = \"\"\n    ),\n    radius = 2\n  ) %>%\n  # Add a legend\n  addLegend(\n    pal = pal,\n    values = ~sid_per_1000birth_79,\n    opacity = 0.5,\n    title = 'SID Rate (per 1000) in 1979',\n    position = \"bottomright\"\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](06-Spatial_Viz_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-31-1.pdf){fig-pos='H' fig-alt='Interactive map of North Carolina with counties colored by SID rate in 1979.'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Resources {-}\n\n* [Prof. Lendway's introductory video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/w5U62wUki3E)   \n* [Prof. Lendway's demo video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/U07OQ3V-W2k)\n* [Detailed `leaflet` documenation](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) (with examples)\n* [`leaflet` cheat sheet](https://ugoproto.github.io/ugo_r_doc/pdf/leaflet-cheat-sheet.pdf)\n* [Provider map previews](http://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/)\n* [Tutorial](https://learn.r-journalism.com/en/mapping/census_maps/census-maps/) by Andrew Ba Tran, investigative data reporter at Washington Post\n* For more advanced work with spatial mapping, GIS in R, etc. see the [sf package](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/).\n\n### Practice: Favorite Places {-}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.exercise .cell-code}\n   \nIn this exercise, you are going to create a single map of some of your favorite places! The end result will be one map.    \n\na. Create a data set using the `tibble()` function that has 10-15 rows of your favorite places. The columns will be the name of the location, the latitude, the longitude, and a column that indicates if it is in your top 3 favorite locations or not. For an example of how to use `tibble()`, look at the `favorite_stp` that is created manually above.     \nb. Create a map that uses circles to indicate your favorite places. Label them with the name of the place. Choose the base map you like best. Color your 3 favorite places differently than the ones that are not in your top 3. Add a legend that explains what the colors mean.   \n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Appendix: R Functions {.unnumbered}\n\n### Mapping Points Functions {.unnumbered}\n\n| Function/Operator |                 Action                 |                       Example |\n|-------------------------|:---------------------------:|------------------:|\n| `ggmap()`        |   Create a plotting canvas with a map background   |   `ggmap(world) + geom_point(...)` |\n| `get_stadiamap(bbox,maptype,zoom)`        |   Fetches a stamen map as background  |   `get_stadiamap(bbox = c(left = -180, bottom = -57, right = 179, top = 82.1), maptype = \"terrain\", zoom = 2)` |\n| `ggthemes::theme_map()`        |   Clean plotting themes for maps  |   `ggmap(world) + geom_point(...) + theme_map()` |\n\n\n\n### Contour/Density Mapping Functions {.unnumbered}\n\n| Function/Operator |                 Action                 |                       Example |\n|-------------------------|:---------------------------:|------------------:|\n| `geom_density_2d`        |   Plots contour maps (2d density)   |   `ggmap(world) + geom_density_2d(data,aes(x,y))` |\n| `stat_density_2d`        |   Plots a filled in contour heat map  |   `ggmap(world) + state_density_2d(data,aes(x,y,fill = stat(level)),geom='polygon')` |\n| `scale_fill_gradient(low,high)`        |   Change fill gradient scale based on a low and high color  |   `ggmap(world) + geom_point(...) + scale_fill_gradient(low='darkblue',high='red')` |\n\n\n### Choropleths Mapping Functions {.unnumbered}\n\n| Function/Operator |                 Action                 |                       Example |\n|-------------------------|:---------------------------:|------------------:|\n| `map_data()`        |  Get map region boundaries from maps package into a dataframe for plotting with ggplot2 |   `state_map <- map_data('state')` |\n| `geom_map()`        |   Links map regions with data set with info about regions and plots it  |   `ggplot(starbucks_us_by_state) + geom_map(map = states_map,aes(map_id = state_name,fill = n))` |\n| `expand_limits(x,y)`        |   Ensure limits include data values in x and y  |   `+ expand_limits(x = states_map$long, y = states_map$lat)` |\n\n\n### Dynamic Mapping Functions {.unnumbered}\n\n| Function/Operator |                 Action                 |                       Example |\n|-------------------------|:---------------------------:|------------------:|\n| `leaflet(data)`        |  Create base dynamic plot |   `leaflet(data = favorite_stp) ` |\n| `addTiles()`        |   Adds the base map - default is openstreet map  |   `+ addTiles()` |\n| `addProviderTiles()`        |   Adds the alternative base maps  |   `+ addProviderTiles(providers$Stamen.Watercolor)` |\n| `addMarkers(lng,lat,label)`        |   Add marker glyphs to dynamic map  |   `+ addMarkers(lng= ~long, lat= ~lat, label=~place)` |\n| `addCircles(lng,lat,label,weight,opactiy,color)`        |   Add circle glyphs to dynamic map  |   `+ addCircles(lng= ~long, lat= ~lat, label=~place, weight=10,opacity=1,color = col2hex('darkblue'))` |\n| `addPolylines(lng,lat)`        |   Add lines that connect locations to dynamic map  |   `+ addPolylines(lng= ~long, lat= ~lat, color = col2hex('darkred'))` |\n| `addPolygons(fillColor,fillOpacity)`        |   Add polygons to dynamic map (if data is sf class)  |   `+ addPolygons()` |\n\n\n\n\n",
