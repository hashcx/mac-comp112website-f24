Put it in a folder `Assignment_06` in `COMP_STAT_112`.\n\n## Joins {-}\n\nA *join* is a verb that means to combine two data tables. \n\n- These tables are often called the *left* and the *right* tables.\n\nThere are several kinds of join.\n\n* All involve establishing a correspondence --- a match --- between each case in the left table and zero or more cases in the right table.\n* The various joins differ in how they handle multiple matches or missing matches.\n\n### Establishing a match between cases {-}\n\nA match between a case in the *left* data table and a case in the *right* data table is made based on the values in **keys**, variables that uniquely define observations in a data table.\n\nAs an example, we'll examine the following two tables on grades and courses. \n\nThe `Grades` [file](data/grades.csv) has one case for each class of each student (student-class pair), and includes variables describing the ID of the student (`sid`), the ID of the session (section of class), and the grade received. \n\nThe `Courses` [file](data/courses.csv) has one case for each section of a class, and includes variables for the ID of the session (section of class), the department (coded as letters), the level, the semester, the enrollment, and the ID of the instructor (`iid`). We show a few rows of each table below.\n\n```{r,cache=TRUE,echo=FALSE}\nGrades <- read_csv(\"data/grades.csv\")\nGrades <- Grades %>%\n  select(sid, sessionID, grade) %>%\n  distinct(sid, sessionID, .keep_all = TRUE)\n```\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE}\nset.seed(101)\nknitr::kable(\n  sample_n(Grades, size = 4),\n  align = \"ccc\", caption = \"Student grades.\"\n)\n```\n\n```{r, cache=TRUE,echo=FALSE}\nCourses <- read_csv(\"data/courses.csv\")\n```\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE}\nset.seed(101)\nknitr::kable(\n  sample_n(Courses, size = 4),\n  align = \"cccccc\", caption = \"Information about each course section.\"\n)\n```\n\n#### Keys {-}\n\nA **primary key** uniquely identifies an observation (a row or case) in its own data table. \n\n`sid` (student ID) and `sessionID` (class ID) are the primary keys for `Grades` as they unique identify each case.\n\n```{r}\n# You can check to make sure that there are no combinations of sid and session ID that have more than 1 row\nGrades %>%\n  count(sid, sessionID) %>%\n  filter(n > 1)\n```\n\n`sessionID` (class ID) and `dept` are the primary keys for `Courses` as they unique identify each case. *You may have guessed that `sessionID` alone was sufficient as the key; however, if a course is cross-listed, then it may have multiple departments listed.*\n\n```{r}\n# check to make sure that there are no combinations \n# of session ID and dept that have more than 1 row\nCourses %>%\n  count(sessionID, dept) %>%\n  filter(n > 1)\n```\n\n\n### Matching {-}\n\nIn order to establish a match between two data tables,\n\n* **You** specify which variables (or keys) to use.\n* Each match is specify as a pair of variables, where one variable from the left table corresponds to one variable from the right table.\n* Cases must have *exactly equal* values in the left variable and right variable for a match to be made.\n\n### Mutating joins {-}\n\nThe first class of joins are mutating joins, which add new variables (columns) to the left data table from matching observations in the right table.^[There is also a `right_join()` that adds variables in the reverse direction from the left table to the right table, but we do not really need it as we can always switch the roles of the two tables.]\n\nThe main difference in the three mutating join options in this class is how they answer the following questions:\n\n1. What happens when a case in the left table has no matches in the right table?\n2. What happens when a case in the right table has no matches in the left table?\n\nThree mutating join functions:\n\n- **`left_join()`**: the output has *all cases from the left*, regardless if there is a match in the right, but discards any cases in the right that do not have a match in the left.\n- **`inner_join()`**: the output has *only the cases from the left with a match in the right*.\n- **`full_join()`**: the output has *all cases from the left and the right*. This is less common than the first two join operators.\n\nWhen there are multiple matches in the right table for a particular case in the left table, all three of these mutating join operators produce a separate case in the new table for each of the matches from the right.\n\n\n\n```{example name=\"Average class size: varying viewpoints\"}\nDetermine the average class size from the viewpoint of a student (getting an average size for each student and the classes they take) and the viewpoint of the Provost / Admissions Office (getting an average size across all classes).\n\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>Solution</summary>\n\n**Provost Perspective:**\n\nThe Provost counts each section as one class and takes the average of all classes. We have to be a little careful and cannot simply do `mean(Courses$enroll)`, because some `sessionID` appear twice on the course list. Why is that?^[They are courses that are cross-listed in multiple departments!] We can still do this from the data we have in the `Courses` table, but we should aggregate by `sessionID` first:\n\n\n```{r}\nCourseSizes <- Courses %>%\n  group_by(sessionID) %>%\n  summarise(total_enroll = sum(enroll))\n\nmean(CourseSizes$total_enroll)\n```\n\n**Student Perspective:**\n\nTo get the average class size from the student perspective, we can join the enrollment of the section onto each instance of a student section. Here, the left table is `Grades`, the right table is `CourseSizes`, we are going to match based on `sessionID`, and we want to add the variable `total_enroll` from `CoursesSizes`.\n\nWe'll use a `left_join` since we aren't interested in any sections from the `CourseSizes` table that do not show up in the `Grades` table; their enrollments should be 0, and they are not actually seen by any students. Note, e.g., if there were 100 extra sections of zero enrollments on the `Courses` table, this would change the average from the Provost's perspective, but not at all from the students' perspective.\n\nIf the `by = ` is omitted from a join, then `R` will perform a *natural join*, which matches the two tables by all variables they have in common. \nIn this case, the only variable in common is the `sessionID`, so we would get the same results by omitting the second argument. In general, this is not reliable unless we check ahead of time which variables the tables have in common. If two variables to match have different names in the two tables, we can write `by = c(\"name1\" = \"name2\")`.\n\n```{r}\nEnrollmentsWithClassSize <- Grades %>%\n  left_join(CourseSizes,\n    by = c(\"sessionID\" = \"sessionID\")\n  ) %>%\n  select(sid, sessionID, total_enroll)\n```\n\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE}\nset.seed(101)\nknitr::kable(\n  sample_n(EnrollmentsWithClassSize, size = 4),\n  align = \"ccc\", caption = \"Student enrollments with the section size.\"\n)\n```\n\n```{r}\nAveClassEachStudent <- EnrollmentsWithClassSize %>%\n  group_by(sid) %>%\n  summarise(ave_enroll = mean(total_enroll, na.rm = TRUE))\n```\n\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE}\nset.seed(101)\nknitr::kable(\n  sample_n(AveClassEachStudent, size = 4),\n  align = \"ccc\", caption = \"Average class size seen by each individual student.\"\n)\n```\n\nThe `na.rm = TRUE` here says that if the class size is not available for a given class, we do not count that class towards the student's average class size. What is another way to capture the same objective? We could have used an `inner_join` instead of a `left_join` when we joined the tables to eliminate any entries from the left table that did not have a match in the right table.\n\nNow we can take the average of the `AveClassEachStudent` table, counting each student once, to find the average class size from the student perspective:\n\n```{r}\nmean(AveClassEachStudent$ave_enroll)\n```\n\nWe see that the average size from the student perspective (24.4) is greater than the average size from the Provost's perspective (21.5). \n</details>\n\n### Filtering joins {-}\n\nThe second class of joins are filtering joins, which select specific cases from the left table based on whether they match an observation in the right table.\n\n- **`semi_join()`**: discards any cases in the left table that *do not have a match* in the right table. If there are multiple matches of right cases to a left case, it keeps just one copy of the left case.\n- **`anti_join()`**: discards any cases in the left table that *have a match* in the right table.\n\nA particularly common employment of these joins is to use a filtered summary as a comparison to select a subset of the original cases, as follows.\n\n```{example, name=\"semi_join to compare to a filtered summary\"}\nFind a subset of the `Grades` data that only contains data on the four largest sections in the `Courses` data set.\n\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>Solution</summary>\n\n```{r}\nLargeSections <- Courses %>%\n  group_by(sessionID) %>%\n  summarise(total_enroll = sum(enroll)) %>%\n  arrange(desc(total_enroll)) %>% head(4)\nGradesFromLargeSections <- Grades %>%\n  semi_join(LargeSections)\n```\n\n</details>\n\n\n```{example,name=\"semi_join\"}\nUse `semi_join()` to create a table with a subset of the rows of `Grades` corresponding to all classes taken in department `J`.\n\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>Solution</summary>\n\nThere are multiple ways to do this. We could do a left join to the `Grades` table to add on the `dept` variable, and then filter by department, then select all variables except the additional `dept` variable we just added. Here is a more direct way with `semi_join` that does not involve adding and subtracting the extra variable:\n\n\n```{r}\nJCourses <- Courses %>%\n  filter(dept == \"J\")\nJGrades <- Grades %>%\n  semi_join(JCourses)\n```\n\nLet's double check this worked. Here are the first few entries of our new table:\n\n```{r jtab, echo=FALSE}\nset.seed(101)\nknitr::kable(\n  JGrades[1:4, ],\n  align = \"ccc\", caption = \"Student enrollments in Department J.\"\n)\n```\n\nThe first entry is for `session1791`. Which department is that course in?\nWhat department should it be?\n\n```{r}\n(Courses %>% filter(sessionID == \"session1791\"))\n```\n\nGreat, it worked! But that only checked the first one. What if we want to double check all of the courses included in Table \\@ref(tab:jtab)? We can add on the department and do a group by to count the number from each department in our table.\n\n```{r}\nJGrades %>%\n  left_join(Courses) %>%\n  count(dept) \n```\n</details>\n\n\n### Practice {-}\n\n```{exercise}\nUse all of your wrangling skills to answer the following questions.\n``` \n\n*Hint 1: start by thinking about what tables you might need to join (if any) and identifying the corresponding variables to match.* \n*Hint 2: you'll need an extra table to convert grades to grade point averages. I've given you the code below.*\n\n\na. How many student enrollments in each department?\nb. What's the grade-point average (GPA) for each student? The average student GPA? *Hint: There are some \"S\" and \"AU\" grades that we want to exclude from GPA calculations. What is the correct variant of join to accomplish this?* \nc. What fraction of grades are below B+?\nd. What's the grade-point average for each instructor?\ne. Estimate the grade-point average for each department. *We cannot actually compute the correct grade-point average for each department from the information we have. The reason why is due to cross-listed courses. Students for those courses could be enrolled under either department, and we do not know which department to assign the grade to. There are a number of possible workarounds to get an estimate. One would be to assign all grades in a section to the department of the instructor, which we'd have to infer from the data.* For this exercise, start by creating a table with all cross-listed courses. Then use an `anti_join` to eliminate all cross-listed courses. Finally, use an `inner_join` to compute the grade-point average for each department.\n\n```{r}\n(GPAConversion <- tibble(grade = c(\"A+\", \"A\", \"A-\", \"B+\", \"B\", \"B-\", \"C+\", \"C\", \"C-\", \"D+\", \"D\", \"D-\", \"NC\"), gp = c(4.3, 4, 3.7, 3.3, 3, 2.7, 2.3, 2, 1.7, 1.3, 1, 0.7, 0)))\n```\n\n## Bicycle-Use Patterns {-}\n\nIn this activity, you'll examine some factors that may influence the use of bicycles in a bike-renting program.  The data come from Washington, DC and cover the last quarter of 2014.\n\n```{r,echo=FALSE,out.width=\"400px\",fig.cap=\"A typical Capital Bikeshare station. This one is at Florida and California, next to Pleasant Pops.\",fig.alt=\"An image of typical Capital Bikeshare station in DC. This one is at Florida and California, next to Pleasant Pops.\"}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/bike_station.jpeg\")\n```\n\n```{r,echo=FALSE,out.width=\"400px\",fig.cap=\"One of the vans used to redistribute bicycles to different stations.\",fig.alt=\"An image of one of the vans used to redistribute bicycles to different stations in the Capital Bikshare system.\"}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/bike_van.jpeg\")\n```\n\n\nTwo data tables are available:\n\n- `Trips` contains records of individual rentals [here](data/2014-Q4-Trips-History-Data-Small.rds)\n- `Stations` gives the locations of the bike rental stations [here](data/DC-Stations.csv)\n\n\nHere is the code to read in the data:^[**Important**: To avoid repeatedly re-reading the files, start the data import chunk with `{r cache = TRUE}` rather than the usual `{r}`.]\n\n```{r cache=TRUE,eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE}\nTrips <- readRDS(\"data/2014-Q4-Trips-History-Data-Small.rds\")\nStations <- read_csv(\"data/DC-Stations.csv\")\n```\n\n```{r cache=TRUE,eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}\ndata_site <-\n  \"https://bcheggeseth.github.io/112_spring_2023/data/2014-Q4-Trips-History-Data-Small.rds\"\nTrips <- readRDS(gzcon(url(data_site)))\nStations <- read_csv(\"https://bcheggeseth.github.io/112_spring_2023/data/DC-Stations.csv\")\n```\n\nThe `Trips` data table is a random subset of 10,000 trips from the full quarterly data. \n\n### Warm-up: Temporal patterns {-}\n\nIt's natural to expect that bikes are rented more at some times of day, some days of the week, some months of the year than others. The variable `sdate` gives the time (including the date) that the rental started.\n\n```{exercise exr-temp, name=\"Warm-up: temporal patterns\"}\nMake the following plots and interpret them:\n```\n\n(a) A density plot of the events versus `sdate`. Use `ggplot()` and `geom_density()`.\n(b) A density plot of the events versus time of day.  You can use `mutate` with `lubridate::hour()`, and `lubridate::minute()` to extract the hour of the day and minute within the hour from `sdate`. Hint: A minute is 1/60 of an hour, so create a field where 3:30 is 3.5 and 3:45 is 3.75.\n(c) A bar plot of the events versus day of the week.\n(d) Facet your graph from (b) by day of the week. Is there a pattern?\n\n\n\nThe variable `client` describes whether the renter is a regular user (level `Registered`) or has not joined the bike-rental organization (`Causal`). Do you think these two different categories of users show different rental behavior? How might it interact with the patterns you found in Exercise \\@ref(exr:exr-temp)?\n\n```{exercise name=\"Customer segmentation\"}\nRepeat the graphic from Exercise \\@ref(exr:exr-temp) (d) with the following changes:\n```\n\n(a) Set the `fill` aesthetic for `geom_density()` to the `client` variable. You may also want to set the `alpha` for transparency and `color=NA` to suppress the outline of the density function.\n(b) Now add the argument `position = position_stack()` to `geom_density()`. In your opinion, is this better or worse in terms of telling a story? What are the advantages/disadvantages of each?\n(c) Rather than faceting on day of the week, create a new faceting variable like this: `mutate(wkday = ifelse(lubridate::wday(sdate) %in% c(1,7), \"weekend\", \"weekday\"))`. What does the variable `wkday` represent? Try to understand the code. \n(d) Is it better to facet on `wkday` and fill with `client`, or vice versa?\n(e) Of all of the graphics you created so far, which is most effective at telling an interesting story?\n\n\n\n### Mutating join practice: Spatial patterns {-}\n\n```{exercise, name=\"Visualization of bicycle departures by station\"}\nUse the latitude and longitude variables in `Stations` to make a visualization of the total number of departures from each station in the `Trips` data. To layer your data on top of a  map, start your plotting code as follows:\n\n```\n\n```\nmyMap<-get_stamenmap(c(-77.1,38.87,-76.975,38.95),zoom=14,maptype=\"terrain\") \nggmap(myMap) + ...\n```\n\nNote: If you want to use Google Maps instead, which do look a bit nicer, you’ll need to get a Google Maps API Key (free but requires credit card to sign up), and then you can use `get_map` instead of `get_stamenmap`.\n\n\n```{exercise}\nOnly 14.4% of the trips in our data are carried out by casual users.^[We can compute this statistic via `mean(Trips$client==\"Casual\")`.] Create a map that shows which area(s) of the city have stations with a much higher percentage of departures by casual users. Interpret your map.\n\n```\n\n\n\n### Filtering join practice: Spatiotemporal patterns {-}\n\n```{exercise, name=\"High traffic points\"}\nConsider the following:\n\n(a) Make a table with the ten station-date combinations (e.g., 14th & V St., 2014-10-14) with the highest number of departures, sorted from most departures to fewest. Hint: `as_date(sdate)` converts `sdate` from date-time format to date format.\n(b) Use a join operation to make a table with only those trips whose departures match those top ten station-date combinations from part (a).\n(c) Group the trips you filtered out in part (b) by client type and `wkday` (weekend/weekday), and count the total number of trips in each of the four groups. Interpret your results.\n\n```\n\n\n## Appendix: R Functions {.unnumbered}\n\n### Mutating Joins {.unnumbered}\n\n| Function/Operator |                 Action                 |
