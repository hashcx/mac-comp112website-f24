Put the file in the existing `Assignment_03` folder within your `COMP_STAT_112` folder.\n\n## Alterative Text for Visualizations {-}\n\nYou should write alt text for every visualization to create. \n\nFrom the last activity: Alt text should concisely articulate (1) what your visualization is (e.g. a bar chart showing which the harvest rate of cucumbers), (2) a one sentence description of the what you think is the most important takeaway your visualization is showing, and (3) a link to your data source if it's not already in the caption (check out this [great resource on writing alt text for data visualizations](https://medium.com/nightingale/writing-alt-text-for-data-visualization-2a218ef43f81)). \n\nTo add the alt text to your the HTML created from knitting the Rmd, you can include it as an option at the top of your R chunk. For example: \\{r, fig.alt = \"Bar chart showing the daily harvest of cucumbers. The peak cucumber collection day is August 18th\"\\}. In this activity, there will be prompts in the template Rmd but you should try to continue doing this for future assignments.\n\n## Bivariate Visualizations {-}\n\nThe outcome of the 2016 presidential election surprised many people.  In this activity we  will analyze data from the 2016 presidential election. To better understand it ourselves, we'll explore county-level election outcomes and demographics.  The data set, prepared by Alicia Johnson, combines 2008/2012/2016 county-level election returns from [Tony McGovern  on github](https://github.com/tonmcg/County_Level_Election_Results_12-16), county-level demographics from the `df_county_demographics` data set within the `choroplethr` R package, and red/purple/blue state designations from [http://www.270towin.com/](http://www.270towin.com/).\n\n### Getting to know the dataset {-}\n\n```{example}\nBegin by loading the [election data](data/electionDemographics16.csv) from \"https://bcheggeseth.github.io/112_spring_2023/data/electionDemographics16.csv\" and getting to know the data.

What other variables (ie. county features) might explain some of the variability in Trump’s support from county to county?

Let's see...\n</details>\n\n\n\n### Background on visualizing relationships {-}\n\nWe've come up with a list of variables that might explain some of the variability in Trump's support from county to county.  Thus we're interested in the relationship between:    \n\n- **<span style=\"color:red\">response variable</span>**: the variable whose variability we would like to explain (Trump's percent of the vote)    \n- **<span style=\"color:red\">predictors</span>**:  variables that might explain some of the variability in the response (percent white, per capita income, state color, etc)\n\n\nOur goal is to construct visualizations that allow us to examine/identify the following features of the relationships among these variables:    \n\n- relationship *trends* (direction and form)   \n- relationship *strength* (degree of variability from the trend)    \n- *outliers* in the relationship\n\nBefore constructing visualizations of the relationship among any set of these variables, we need to understand what features these should have.  As with univariate plots, the appropriate visualization also depends upon whether the variables are quantitative or categorical. \n\nRecall some **basic rules in constructing graphics:** \n\n- Each **quantitative variable** requires a new axis.  (We'll discuss later what to do when we run out of axes!)    \n- Each **categorical variable** requires a new way to \"group\" the graphic (eg: using colors, shapes, separate facets, etc to capture the grouping)    \n- For visualizations in which **overlap** in glyphs or plots obscures the patterns, try faceting or transparency. \n\n\n\n\n```{example, name=\"Mock-Ups\"}\nConsider a subset  of the variables: \n\n```\n\n```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))\n\nfd <- elect %>%\n  filter(region %in% c(8039, 28003, 40129, 29119, 13247, 27027)) %>%\n  select(c(county, abb, perrep_2016, perrep_2012, winrep_2016, StateColor)) %>%\n  mutate(perrep_2016 = round(perrep_2016, 2), perrep_2012 = round(perrep_2012, 2))\nknitr::kable(fd)\n```\n\nIn groups, sketch on paper a mock-up of a visualization of the relationship between the given pair of variables (i.e., what type of chart is appropriate to demonstrate the relationship?):\n\na.

Among `perrep_2012`, `median_rent` and `percent_white`, which is the best predictor of `perrep_2016`?

Work through the several options below.    \n\n```{example name=\"Side-by-Side Density Plots\"}\nWe can show density plots for each state color next to each other:\n```\n\na.

Notice that `ggplot` randomly assigns colors to group based on alphabetical order.  In this example, the random color doesn't match the group itself (red/purple/blue)!  We can fix this:    \n\n```{r eval=FALSE}\nggplot(elect, aes(x = perrep_2016, fill = StateColor)) +\n  geom_density() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\"))\n```    \n\nc. The overlap between the groups makes it difficult to explore the features of each.

Yet another option is to separate the density plots into separate \"facets\" defined by group:  \n\n```{r eval=FALSE}\nggplot(elect, aes(x = perrep_2016, fill = StateColor)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\")) +\n  facet_wrap(~ StateColor)\n```\n    \n\n```{exercise name=\"Side-by-Side Histograms\"}\nLet's try a similar strategy using histograms to illustrate the relationship between `perrep_2016` and `StateColor`.    \n```\n\na.

Their data are available in the `fivethirtyeight` package:    \n\n```{r}\nlibrary(fivethirtyeight)\ndata(bechdel)\n```\n    \nIn investigating budgets and profits, the authors \"focus on films released from 1990 to 2013, since the data has significantly more depth since then.\"  Use the following code to filter out just the movies in these years and name the resulting data set `Beyond1990` (don't worry about the syntax):    \n\n```{r}\nlibrary(dplyr)\nBeyond1990 <- bechdel %>%\n  filter(year >= 1990)\n```\n\n```{exercise}\nAddress the following:\n  \na. Construct a visualization that addresses the following research question: Do bigger budgets (`budget_2013`) pay off with greater box office returns (`domgross_2013`)?  In constructing this visualization, add a smooth to highlight trends and pay attention to which of these variables is the response.       \nb. Using your visualization as supporting evidence, answer the research question.          \nc. Part of the fivethirtyeight article focuses on how budgets (`budget_2013`) differ among movies with different degrees of female character development (`clean_test`).  Construct a visualization that highlights the relationship between these two variables.  There are many options - some are better than others!       \nd. Using your visualization as supporting evidence, address fivethirtyeight's concerns.  \n```\n\n```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}\n# a\nggplot(Beyond1990, aes(y = domgross_2013, x = budget_2013)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.1) +\n  geom_smooth()\n\n# b\n# profits tend to increase with budget but the relationship is fairly weak\n\n# c\n# one option:\nggplot(Beyond1990, aes(x = budget_2013, fill = clean_test)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +\n  facet_wrap(~clean_test)\n\n# d\n# Budgets tend to be smaller among movies the pass the Bechdel test.\n```\n\n```{exercise}\nNOTE: The following exercise is inspired by a similar exercise proposed by Albert Kim, one of the `fivethirtyeight` package authors.    \n    Return to the fivethirtyeight.com article and examine the plot titled \"The Bechdel Test Over Time\".    \n```\n\na. Summarize the trends captured by this plot.  (How has the representation of women in movies evolved over time?)   \nb. Recreate this plot from the article!  \n\nTo do so, you'll need to create a new data set named `newbechdel` in which the order of the Bechdel categories (`clean_test`) and the year categories (`yearCat`) match those used by fivethirtyeight.  Don't worry about the syntax:    \n```{r}\nlibrary(dplyr)\nnewbechdel <- bechdel %>%\nmutate(clean_test = factor(bechdel$clean_test, c(\"nowomen\", \"notalk\", \"men\", \"dubious\", \"ok\"))) %>%\nmutate(yearCat = cut(year, breaks = seq(1969, 2014, by = 5)))\n```    \n\nFurther, you'll need to add the following layer in order to get a color scheme that's close to that in the article: \n    \n```{r eval=FALSE}\nscale_fill_manual(values = c(\"red\", \"salmon\", \"pink\", \"steelblue1\", \"steelblue4\"))\n```\n    \nNOTE: that your plot won't look *exactly* like the authors', but should be close to this:    \n    \n```{r, out.width = \"800px\",echo=FALSE, fig.alt='Proportional barplot of Bechdel test results across 5 year time periods. An increasing number of movies pass the Bechdel test over time but still only make up about 50% of the movies in the most recent time period.'}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/bechdel_hist.jpeg\")\n```\n\n## Appendix: R Functions {.unnumbered}\n\n### Data Wrangling R functions {.unnumbered}\n\n| Function/Operator |
